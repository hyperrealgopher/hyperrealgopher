I'm a [Gopher protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29) and Haskell enthusiast.

I've been using Haskell to develop [Waffle](https://github.com/hyperrealgopher/waffle) (Gopher client) and a [gopherhole builder called "burrow."](https://github.com/hyperrealgopher/burrow)

Please also see [my gists](https://gist.github.com/hyperrealgopher).
