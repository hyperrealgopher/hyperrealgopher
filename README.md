I'm a [Gopher protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29) enthusiast.

I'm learning and am okay with Haskell.

I've been using Haskell to develop [Waffle](https://github.com/hyperrealgopher/waffle) (Gopher client) and a soon-to-be-released gopherhole builder.

For more information about me on my tor-only gopherhole: [`gopher://hyperzzzk4zxiyghqnkrgi67hmqn2tr7ju4zoyi3hlzapm3pxh5vkhqd.onion`](gopher://hyperzzzk4zxiyghqnkrgi67hmqn2tr7ju4zoyi3hlzapm3pxh5vkhqd.onion).
